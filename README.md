# Dada2-microbiome-analysis
Producing an example of microbiome analysis using the Dada2 pipeline. The codes from the Dada2 pipeline workflow tutorial (1.16) from https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html are adapted for use in this project. The microbiome dataset used is the same as the data for the mothur MiSeq SOP https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/, but the metadata used in subsequent data analysis has been modified.
